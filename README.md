# RAIKINS PROP PLACER SYSTEM

### WARNING THE GIT ROOT WILL NOT BE USABLE INSIDE THE GAME PLEASE REFER TO THE PUBLIC RELEASES!

Hello, fellow LOTA and ATF players! Iâ€™ve put together a wacky prop placement system inspired by ATF-8 and LOTA3. This document will walk you through how it works! I will include examples on how to use it but other then that you are on your own! This is not documenation for the included `Helper Modules` Do not mess with those if you do not know what you are doing.

To start you will need to require your module once on server once on client.

## Server
```lua
local PropPlacer = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Prop_Placer__V7 -- Since this is server you do not need to wait for the module.

local Server = PropPlacer.GetServer()

Server:EasyInit()
```


## Client
```lua
local PropPlacer = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("P_Placer"):WaitForChild("Prop_Placer__V7"))

local Client = PropPlacer.GetClient()

Client:BindStandardControls() -- This can be ignored if you are gonna custom bind it. just mind you this is not recommended
```
---
# LITE CODE GUIDE
## CLIENT

Gotten via `PropPlacer.GetClient()`

### `Client:BindStandardControls()`
```
This function will extend the standard control format to the prop placer for easy setup.

STANDARD CONTROL FORMATS:

F:
    - Place a prop or confirm editing a prop.

X:
    - Delete the selected prop.
    - Delete props you click while holding X.
    - Delete all selected props.
    - Cancel editing props.

E:
    - In selection mode: press E to enter group editing.
    - While holding E: click a prop to edit it individually.

LEFT ALT:
    - Toggle selection mode on or off.

Q:
    - In selection mode: select all props or unselect all props.

LEFT SHIFT:
    - In selection mode: hold to drag-select multiple props.

V:
    - Switch between manual dragging and follow-mouse placement.

R:
    - Switch to rotation mode for the selected prop.

T:
    - Switch to movement mode for the selected prop.
```

### `Client:GetInfo()`

```
