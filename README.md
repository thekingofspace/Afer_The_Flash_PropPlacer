# RAIKINS PROP PLACER SYSTEM

### WARNING THE GIT ROOT WILL NOT BE USABLE INSIDE THE GAME PLEASE REFER TO THE PUBLIC RELEASES!

Hello, fellow LOTA and ATF players! Iâ€™ve put together a wacky prop placement system inspired by ATF-8 and LOTA3. This document will walk you through how it works! I will include examples on how to use it but other then that you are on your own! This is not documenation for the included `Helper Modules` Do not mess with those if you do not know what you are doing.

To start you will need to require your module once on server once on client.

## Server
```lua
local PropPlacer = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Prop_Placer__V7 -- Since this is server you do not need to wait for the module.

local Server = PropPlacer.GetServer()

Server:EasyInit()
```


## Client
```lua
local PropPlacer = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("P_Placer"):WaitForChild("Prop_Placer__V7"))

local Client = PropPlacer.GetClient()

Client:BindStandardControls() -- This can be ignored if you are gonna custom bind it. just mind you this is not recommended
```
---
# LITE CODE GUIDE
## CLIENT

Gotten via `PropPlacer.GetClient()`

### `Client:BindStandardControls()`
```
This function will extend the standard control format to the prop placer for easy setup.

STANDARD CONTROL FORMATS:

F:
    - Place a prop or confirm editing a prop.

X:
    - Delete the selected prop.
    - Delete props you click while holding X.
    - Delete all selected props.
    - Cancel editing props.

E:
    - In selection mode: press E to enter group editing.
    - While holding E: click a prop to edit it individually.

LEFT ALT:
    - Toggle selection mode on or off.

Q:
    - In selection mode: select all props or unselect all props.

LEFT SHIFT:
    - In selection mode: hold to drag-select multiple props.

V:
    - Switch between manual dragging and follow-mouse placement.

R:
    - Switch to rotation mode for the selected prop.

T:
    - Switch to movement mode for the selected prop.
```

### `Client:GetInfo()`
```
Returns info from the server to the client `{MaxProps = NUMBER, Props = SaveData(Refer to TypeDefinitions.PropSave for assembly.), OwnerPacks = Table of packs owned.}`
```
---
### `Client:GetInfoLight()`
```
Returns info from the server to the client `{MaxProps = NUMBER, OwnerPacks = Table of packs owned.}` This was made as a lite version of GetInfo so it doesnt pass back a massive table of prop save info.

# TECHNICAL CODE GUIDE

```
---
### `PlayerController:SetMaxProps(PL:Player, Count:number)`

---
### `PlayerController:SetMaxPropsTemp(PL:Player, Count:number)`

# RAIKINS WEATHER AND ZONE SYSTEM
Down here will go into detail on how zones work!

## CLIENT

Gotten via `SubZone.GetClient()`

### `Client:ResumeTime()`
```
Resumes the time reviving the OnTick and OnHour events. Note when paused client still recieves on weather calls.
```
---
### `Client:PauseTime()`
```
Pauses the time killing the OnTick and OnHour events. Note when paused client still recieves on weather calls.
```
---
### `Client:SetTime(Time:number)`
```
Force changes the global time, this will desync from server. until next server update.
```
---
### `Client:CreateZone(ZoneID:string, Parts:{BasePart})`
### Creation
```
So on creating a subzone you input your ZoneID and the parts that make up the zone.

This will then make those parts Anchored, NonCollide but with Query.
```

### ZoneUpdates
```
On a player entering/exiting a zone it will add the OnZoneEnter and OnZoneExit to a que, each renderstep

it will check the next item in que then triggering the correct event.
```
---
### `Client:SetTimeRate(Calc_Type:Enumerator.Custom_Enum, Time:number)`
```
The first enum makes it easier to set your timerate. Time is the number being used
```
---
### `Client:GetTime()`
```
Returns the global synced weather.
```
---
### `Client:GetWeather()`
```
Returns the global synced time from server so when you resume time it will match the server!
```

---
### `Client.OnHour`
### Code Example:
```lua
Client.OnHour:Connect(function(Time: number)
    -- Code goes here
end)
```
---
### `Client.OnTick`
### Code Example:
```lua
Client.OnTick:Connect(function(Time: number)
    -- Code goes here
end)
```
---
### `Client.OnZoneExit`
### Code Example:
```lua
Client.OnZoneExit:Connect(function(Action:Enumerator.Custom_Enum, SubID:string)

end)

```
---
### `Client.OnZoneEnter`
### Code Example:
```lua
Client.OnZoneEnter:Connect(function(Action:Enumerator.Custom_Enum, SubID:string)

end)

```
